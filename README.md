This is a fun little side project that aims to do crazy stuff with prompt engineering to allow the dynamic creation of Non-Player Characters (NPC) with memory, in order to allow quick generation of random ones to curated generation of main NPCs. 

Primary goal is to get at least 3 ways to generate an NPC
1) Random attributes
2) Chose attributes
3) Random generated based on an image upload

Long term is to have not just conversational memory, but world building info for Game Masters that write up their own worlds, as well as custom memories and events
AND
Last, but not least, a demeanor, nature, attitude, emotional state, that changes based on events and interaction with players.
